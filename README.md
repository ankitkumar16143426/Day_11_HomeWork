Basically in this Project We using DOM manipulation using JS Event Listener, and create a basic tip  Calculater Project.
first of all we crate a main div that's  id="container". and  after tha take the label.
After thai create the sum Option that is :-
   Good
   It was okay
   Bad
   Terrible
   And  after that we take a input type taxt area and create a Button that will be use for to calculate the value,
   after that we apply css ( css flex  box and sum background image)  and style the sum basic part

   In java script we get the element for these method document.getElementById and  apply addEventListener on cleck event and calculate 
   for these formula (billamount*serviceQuality)/numPeople
